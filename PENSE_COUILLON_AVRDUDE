Needed Program called avrdude to upload the binary onto the target, 
and modify the parameters according to the board setup and target:

mcu=atmega8
f_cpu=16000000
format=ihex
rate=19200
port=/dev/ttyusb0
programmer=stk500
target_file=test.hex

avrdude -F -p $mcu -P $port -c $programmer -b $rate -U flash:w:$target_file
Installing avrdude:

sudo apt-get install avrdude 

Also there is a comprehensive Makefile that you could use to build and upload to your Arduino which again 
uses the similar avrdude commands to upload to the target. After changing the parameters in the Makefile, 
run make upload to upload the hex file to the target.

NOTE: Need to have gcc-avr and avr-libc packages installed to build the binaries
