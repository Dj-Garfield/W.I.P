# W.I.P
All My Work In Progress

Sorry , but I'm not a developper , I just use some portion of code that I modify for my 
own use . I let it here to access it every where I am :) You can use it as your own risk 
But you can use freely if you want :) 

if you discover some mistake or if you want update some of the informations , feel free to fork and/or ask for a pull request , I will be proud to include your contribution.

All the documents here are free to use , you can add my git link in your update if you want , I don't care about properties or something else , I just leave this here to share a piece of knowledge.

## Enjoy
