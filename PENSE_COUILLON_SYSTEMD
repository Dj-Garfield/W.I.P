Using systemd you should be able to run a script as a daemon by creating a simple unit. There are a lot of different options you can add but this is about as simple as you can get.

Say you have a script /usr/bin/mydaemon.

#!/bin/sh

while true; do
  date;
  sleep 60;
done


You create a unit /etc/systemd/system/mydaemon.service.

[Unit]
Description=My daemon

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mydaemon
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target 
To start the demon you run

systemctl start mydaemon.service 
To start at boot you enable it

systemctl enable mydaemon.service
